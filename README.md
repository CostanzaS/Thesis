* Ran using both Google colab and Anaconda environment  
* Language : Python 3

## Neighbour-based CF
Dataset MovieLens 100K Dataset with explicit feedback – ratings https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

## Latent models with explicit feedback
NMF  SGD  : surprise library (http://surpriselib.com)

## Latent models with implicit feedback
dataset : Use Last.FM with implicit feedback – artist listening records https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/

* WRMF : https://github.com/Coder-Yu/RecQ  (to be noted, in the WMF folder have been uploaded only the files that were converted from python 2 to python 3 )

* BPR : https://github.com/sh0416/bpr


## How?
1. Download dataset and notebook
2. Install needed packages
3. Run 

  * Models using explicit feedbacks and BPR notebooks on google colab
  * WRMF lauching  jupyter notebook from anaconda and locate the WRMF notebook in the 'main' folder in order to run 
  
4. To conclude, do not forget to change the data paths before running.
